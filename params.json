I figured, since there were other people looking for a solution to this on the net, I should publish it.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n```pip install win_inet_pton```\r\n\r\nJust import it, and it will auto-add the methods to the socket library:\r\n```\r\nimport win_inet_pton\r\nimport socket\r\n\r\nsocket.inet_pton(...)\r\nsocket.inet_ntop(...)\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
